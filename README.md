# ffavc

ffavc is a video decoder built on ffmpeg which allows libpag to use ffmpeg as its software decoder
for h264 decoding.

## Dependency management

Go to the root directory of ffavc project, use the following command to pull the third-party libraryï¼š

```
git submodule update --init
```

## Build ffmpeg

First, make sure you have built the ffmpeg vendor libraries.

### Windows platform

1. Install Visual Studio 2019.

2. Install [<font color=blue>mysy2</font>](https://www.msys2.org/)

3. Install some dependencies

```
pacman -S make gcc diffutils mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-pkg-config mingw-w64-i686-nasm mingw-w64-i686-yasm
```

4. Rename msys64/usr/bin/link.exe to msys64/usr/bin/link.bak, to avoid conflict with MSVC's link.exe

5. Run "VS2019 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt" (Run "VS2019 x86_x64 Native Tools Command Prompt"
   for 64-bit.)

6. Go to the mingw installation directory and run, (usually located in C:\workspace\windows\msys64):

```
msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32 -use-full-path (-mingw64 for 64-bit)
```

7. Finally, go to the root directory of ffavc project, run:

```
build_ffmpeg.sh
```

### Web platform

1. Go to the root directory of ffavc project, run:

``` bash
build_ffmpeg.sh
```

2. Go to the root directory of web/script directory, run:

``` bash
build.sh
```

### Other platforms

Go to the root directory of ffavc project, run:

```
build_ffmpeg.sh
```

The script will generate ffmpeg libraries to `vendor/ffmpeg` directory.

## Build ffavc

After ffmpeg libraries are built, you can open this project by CLion to build, or simply build it
with the cmake command-line tool.
